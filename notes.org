** Documentation

** Emacs

Menu Haskell/Load file seems to load all the imports.

** Strange problems

When you have a problem with missing Cairo libraries and REPL doesn't see the
new libraries, it might be worth to close the REPL and start new one after
running stack install

** Debugging
Open Snake.hs file
Haskell menu Load file

REPL running
:reload
:load Snake
main

REPL debugging
:break cook
main
:show bindings
:step
:show context
:continue
:print model
:sprint model
:delete *
